# ARDUINO-OBSTACLE-AVOIDANCE-ROBOT
This project involves building a simple Obstacle Avoidance Robot using Arduino. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate its environment by detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement and motors to move in different directions to avoid any detected obstacles.
